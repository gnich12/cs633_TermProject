Another useful tool would be nodemon. this is a small app that will monitor the changes to your code
and you wont have to reset the server manually, it will do it automatically. to install it go to the directory 
of your project and type

Some instructions
If you want to add new a css file or a javascript file on the head of the html
modify the file head.ejs on partials. Same thing for the footer and also if you need to add a
script to the end of the file you can added to the bootstrap_script.ejs files

you can use the starter.ejs to start a page for the app.
